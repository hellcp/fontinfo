How to add new image format handler:

1. duplicate nearest existing img-foo.c and img-foo.h to img-bar.c 
   and img-bar.h respectively
2. adjust new img_bar.c img_bar.h to format needs: write_bar_specimen()
   write_bar_minispecimen() and write_bar_charset() are needed
3. add new image handler identificator BAR to fontoutput_t in configuration.h
4. adjust img.c to reflect new image handler: direct write_*() to invoke 
   appropriate write_bar_* functions from img_bar.c
3. adjust fontinfo.c to reflect new image handler: adjust usage() function 
   to add new possibility for image format option (-o at the time of writing)
4. adjust Makefile rules to build new files and link result to fontinfo
