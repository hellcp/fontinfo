How to add new style:

1. duplicate nearest existing foo-style.c and foo-style.h to bar-style.c 
   and bar-style.h respectively
2. adjust new bar-style.c bar-style.h to your needs:
   a. change foo_*() functions to bar_*()
   b. on CSS level, it should be enough to adjust bar_page() function
   c. if needed, main contents of page is to be adjusted in static content_*() 
      functions
3. adjust fontinfo.c to reflect new style
   a. include bar-style.h there
   b. define BAR_STYLE constant string
   c. adjust usage() function to add new possibility for style option (-y
      at the time of writing)
   d. adjust main() to call bar_*() functions
4. adjust Makefile rules to build new files and link result to fontinfo
